# A Python-based channel access simulator for IEEE 802.11-based wireless networks

# Introduction

This simulator is wrritten in Python to understand the MAC mechansim of IEEE 802.11 based Wireless Network. The ultimate aim of this simulator is to implement the Spatial Reuse mechanism and to capture the operation of the MAC mechanism in each timeslot. This simulator allows different input parameters such as number of nodes, simulation area, minimum required SNR, frame length, simulation time and returns the following node parameters as the parimary results: 
Node transmission opportunities
Average collision rate 
Average CWmin per TXOP/Sucessful transmission
Average defer per TXOP/Suessful Transmission.

# Usage
To run the simulator it is sufficient to run the main.py file.
