# A Python-based channel access simulator for IEEE 802.11-based wireless networks

# Introduction

This simulator is wrritten in Python to understand the MAC mechansim of IEEE 802.11 based Wireless Network. The ultimate aim to build the simulator is to implement the Spatial Reuse mechanism and to capture the operation
of the MAC mechanism in each time-slot. This simulator allows different input parameters such as number of nodes, simulation area, minimum required SNR, frame length, simulation time and returns the following node parameters as the parimary results: node transmission opportunities, average collision rate, average CWmin per TXOP/Sucessful transmission and average defer per TXOP/Suessdul Transmission as the primary results. 

# Usage
To run the simulator it is sufficient to run the main.py file.
